(Last updated April 9 2025)

## Overview
Students may learn the basics of computer science as part of their middle school and high school curriculum. One topic of interest of developing computer science skills is the ability to code. For many students, coding courses are not offered until high school; even then, some schools may not have the resources to provide students the technological necessary to code, such as computers, internet, or coding consoles. 

This workshop exposes its students to the world of Python coding, encompassing the fundamental structures of Python and integrating them into basic functions. Faculty and cadets will review Python basics and applications, students will work in teams to problem solve different exercises, and the final activity will develop a game using a culmination of these topics.
